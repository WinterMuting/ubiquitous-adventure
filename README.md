<h1>Hello world</h1>
<br>
<p>As of now, I'm only getting seek here. Hide  may require an air gapped unit, public IP, skills and exp, resources and money. I have none of these. <br>The good news is that, surprisingly, I might have just enough common sense. I don't know. It never occured to me that spending hours on learning IT, building the Internet, gathering all human knowledge, creating sophisticated AI and then turning the whole thing into another warfare makes up for a plan<br>
I guess I'm not very creative.  <br> I read quite a lot and  realized that I must reinstate my goals: quit wasting time on futile attempts to gain knowledge, practical skills, create stuff and help other derelicts. That's not the point.<br> The ponit is to hide and seek. In a war zone, where else?</p>
